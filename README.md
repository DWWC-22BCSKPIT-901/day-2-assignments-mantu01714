# DAY-2


## 1. **Majority Element**
### Objective
Find the majority element in an array of integers, where the majority element is the one that appears more than `n/2` times.

### Example
- Input: `[3, 3, 4, 2, 3, 3]` → Output: `3`

### Task
Write a program that:
1. Accepts an array of integers.
2. Returns the majority element if one exists, or indicates that no majority element exists.

---

## 2. **Pascal's Triangle**
### Objective
Generate Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows.

### Example
For 5 rows, the output should be:

### Task
Write a program that:
1. Takes an integer `N` as input.
2. Prints the first `N` rows of Pascal's Triangle.

---

## 3. **Container With Most Water**
### Objective
Given an array where each element represents the height of a vertical line, find two lines that, together with the x-axis, form a container that holds the most water.

### Example
- Input: `[1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]` → Output: `49` (formed by heights at indices 1 and 8).

### Task
Write a program that:
1. Accepts an array of integers representing heights.
2. Returns the maximum area of water the container can hold.

---

## 4. **Maximum Number of Groups Getting Fresh Donuts**
### Objective
Solve the problem of dividing people into groups such that the number of donuts each group gets is maximized.

### Example
- Input: People = 5, Donuts = 10
- Output: Maximum groups that can enjoy donuts.

### Task
Write a program that:
1. Accepts the number of people and donuts.
2. Outputs the maximum number of groups.

---

## 5. **Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs**
### Objective
Distribute jobs among workers to minimize the maximum time required to finish all jobs.

### Example
- Input: Jobs = `[3, 2, 3]`, Workers = `2`
- Output: `3` (Minimum time to finish all jobs with 2 workers).

### Task
Write a program that:
1. Accepts an array of job durations and the number of workers.
2. Returns the minimum time required to complete all jobs.
